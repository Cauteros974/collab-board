# Collab-Board

This project is a modern, fully client-side task management board, built on the principles of a Kanban board, similar to tools like Trello or Jira. It is designed to support basic collaborative team work and is implemented using modern React technologies.

# Project Overview

The project is an interactive whiteboard with the ability to drag and drop tasks between columns.

# Key Futures:
  1. Kanban Board: Tasks are organized into columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) and can be moved between them using drag-and-drop functionality.
  2.Task Management:
  
  • Creation, deletion, and detailed viewing/editing of tasks.
  
  • Tasks include Priority (Low, Medium, High), which is visually indicated by color.
  
  • Support for Tags (Labels) for quick categorization (Design, Dev, Bug, etc.) with automatic color assignment.
